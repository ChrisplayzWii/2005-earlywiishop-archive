<h3>Huge credit to <a href="https://github.com/MrRM05">RM05 (github)</a> /// <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Mr_RM05">RM05 (youtube)</a>  for taking the previously impossible to use CVS files (history log files with filename,v) and removing the ,v to make them usable again using cvs checkout. <br> i plan to turn these jsps into plain html soon and host it but thats for a later date :P </h3>
